# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To design UML diagrams for a Hospital Management System to model its structure and functionality.

## SRS (Procedure):

Create the following UML diagrams for the Hospital Management System.

1. Activity Diagram
Shows the workflow of hospital operations such as patient registration, appointment booking, diagnosis, billing, and discharge.

2. Class Diagram
Represents the main classes like Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Billing, and Medicine, along with their attributes, methods, and relationships.

3. Communication Diagram
Illustrates how objects such as Doctor, Patient, Receptionist, and Database interact and exchange information during hospital activities.

4. Package Diagram
Organizes the system into functional modules such as Patient Management, Doctor Management, Appointment Scheduling, and Billing System, showing their interdependencies.

5. Sequence Diagram
Depicts the time-based flow of messages between users, system components, and the database during operations like patient admission, appointment booking, or bill generation.

6. Use Case Diagram
Displays all possible user interactions with the system, such as registering patients, booking appointments, maintaining records, and processing payments.
